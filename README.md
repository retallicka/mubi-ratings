# Mubi Ratings Chrome Extension


The easiest way to install is to download from the Chrome Webstore [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mubi-ratings/dnpdjibenonbeglpjdklibeiodfjndlh?authuser=1)

Or you can download the repo and load unpacked into Chrome.

Please report any problems with the issues tool. The extension frequently breaks due to Mubi changing their site design and markup.

Since August 2016 [rottentomatoes](http://rottentomatoes.com) API is only available paid for businesses.
I am using [omdb](http://omdbapi.com) instead. Unfortunately that API has some limitations so the results aren't as accurate as they were previously.
